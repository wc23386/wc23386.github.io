# Multilayered Network ML Analysis of News Credibility and Community Vulnerability to Misinformation
ðŸ“… Project Duration: September 2024 â€“ December 2024
This project explores how online communities engage with political misinformation, using Reddit as a case study. By constructing a multilayered network of news sources based on credibility and analyzing user interactions, the study identifies communities most susceptible to low-credibility or biased content.
## Key Methods:
1. LLM-Based Credibility Scoring & Bias Analysis: Implementing a language model architecture to assign credibility scores across nine news sources, positioning communities within a credibility-bias space to track their media exposure and engagement trends.
2. User Embedding & Community Detection: Mapping user groups based on relationships between posts and news sources.
3. ACE Scoring for Anomaly Detection: Identifying behavioral anomalies in heterogeneous networks to highlight communities at higher risk.

The projectâ€™s main contribution lies in understanding how media exposure influences community susceptibility over time, offering insights into misinformation spread and potential mitigation strategies.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %} -->
