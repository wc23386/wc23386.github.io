ðŸ“… **Project Duration:** September 2024 â€“ December 2024

## Overview
This project develops a novel framework for analyzing community vulnerability to misinformation through a multilayered network approach. Using Reddit as a case study, we combine LLM-based credibility scoring with network analysis to identify and understand communities at risk of misinformation exposure.

## Key Methods

### 1. LLM-Based Credibility Analysis
- **Credibility Scoring Engine**: Implementation of GPT-4 for systematic evaluation of news source reliability
- **Bias Detection**: Analysis of political bias across news sources using transformer-based classification
- **Source Verification**: Cross-validation with established fact-checking databases

### 2. Network Architecture
- **Multilayer Structure**:
  - Layer 1: User-Community Interactions
  - Layer 2: News Source Credibility Network
  - Layer 3: Community-Content Engagement
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Temporal tracking of community engagement patterns
- **Cross-Layer Correlations**: Analysis of information flow between network layers

### 3. Vulnerability Assessment
- **ACE (Anomaly-Community-Exposure) Scoring**:
  - Behavioral pattern analysis
  - Engagement intensity metrics
  - Content diversity measurement
- **Risk Indicators**:
  - Echo chamber formation probability
  - Misinformation spread velocity
  - Community resilience metrics

## Technical Implementation
- Python-based analysis pipeline using NetworkX and PyTorch
- BERT-based text classification for content categorization
- Graph Neural Networks for community structure analysis
- Dynamic visualization using Plotly and NetworkX

## Impact & Results
- Identified key patterns in community susceptibility to misinformation
- Developed predictive models for early detection of vulnerable communities
- Created visualization tools for tracking information spread
- Proposed intervention strategies for at-risk communities
