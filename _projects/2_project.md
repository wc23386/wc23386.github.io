## Overview
This project investigates the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize energy management systems (EMS) in modern infrastructures, focusing on buildings. The research leverages time-series data from advanced control systems to enhance real-time battery charging and scheduling, addressing the challenge of balancing fluctuating energy demand with available resources.

## Key Contributions
### 1. Real-Time Decision Making
- Implementation of RL models and MDP framework
- Dynamic adaptation to fluctuating energy demands
- Policy optimization for real-time decision-making
- Integration with variable renewable energy generation

### 2. Multi-Objective Energy Purchasing Optimization
- Development of intelligent scheduling strategies
- Consideration of multiple factors:
  - Load demand patterns
  - Grid electricity pricing
  - Solar power generation
  - Battery state of charge (SoC)

### 3. Sustainable Energy Integration
- Integration of PV power generation systems
- Carbon pricing implementation
- Battery optimization strategies
- Support for carbon-aware energy management

## Impact
This research demonstrates how data-driven, intelligent energy management can lead to more sustainable, cost-effective infrastructures, contributing to global sustainability efforts by reducing carbon footprints and optimizing renewable energy use.
