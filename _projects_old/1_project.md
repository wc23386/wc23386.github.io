ðŸ“… Project Duration: September 2024 â€“ December 2024
This project explores how online communities engage with political misinformation, using Reddit as a case study. By constructing a multilayered network of news sources based on credibility and analyzing user interactions, the study identifies communities most susceptible to low-credibility or biased content.
## Key Methods:
1. LLM-Based Credibility Scoring & Bias Analysis: Implementing a language model architecture to assign credibility scores across nine news sources, positioning communities within a credibility-bias space to track their media exposure and engagement trends.
2. User Embedding & Community Detection: Mapping user groups based on relationships between posts and news sources.
3. ACE Scoring for Anomaly Detection: Identifying behavioral anomalies in heterogeneous networks to highlight communities at higher risk.

The projectâ€™s main contribution lies in understanding how media exposure influences community susceptibility over time, offering insights into misinformation spread and potential mitigation strategies.
