This project focuses on analyzing the Texas renewable power grid using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and representation learning techniques. These methods are designed to model complex relationships between weather variables and energy production while capturing the spatial dependencies and topological structures of the power grid. By leveraging these advanced techniques, we aim to accurately predict energy generation patterns influenced by varying weather conditions.

## Key Methods:
1. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):
 GNNs are utilized to model the topology of the renewable power grid, where nodes represent different power generation sources (e.g., wind turbines, solar panels) and edges represent the power lines between them. GNNs enable us to efficiently learn from the interactions between meteorological stations and power generation, while also considering spatial dependencies within the grid.


2. Representation Learning:
 To better understand the impact of weather on energy systems, we apply representation learning techniques to transform raw weather data into meaningful feature representations. This allows the model to learn the complex relationships between temperature, wind speed, and solar irradiance, and how these factors jointly influence power grid behavior.

## Impact:
 By combining GNNs with representation learning techniques, this study offers a more comprehensive approach to understanding the weather-dependent dynamics of renewable energy production. The results have the potential to improve the forecasting, optimization, and management of power grids, enabling more efficient integration of renewable sources and supporting the transition toward a sustainable energy future.
