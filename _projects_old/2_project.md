ðŸ“… Project Duration: January 2024 â€“ May 2024
This project investigates the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize energy management systems (EMS) in modern infrastructures, with a specific focus on buildings. Leveraging the growing availability of time-series data from advanced control systems, RL-based approaches aim to enhance real-time battery charging and scheduling. The goal is to address the challenge of balancing fluctuating energy demand with available resources, ensuring both efficiency and sustainability.

## Key Contributions:
1. Real-Time Decision Making:
 Implementing RL models and the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to dynamically adapt to fluctuating energy demands, variable renewable energy generation, and changing electricity prices. This aspect focuses on policy optimization to improve real-time decision-making.


2. Multi-Objective Energy Purchasing Optimization:
 Developing strategies to simultaneously minimize energy costs by considering multiple factors, including load demand, electricity prices from the grid, solar power generation, and the state of charge (SoC) of batteries. This is achieved through intelligent scheduling to optimize purchasing decisions.


3. Sustainable Energy Integration:
 Integrating photovoltaic (PV) power generation, carbon pricing, and battery optimization to ensure both economic and environmental benefits. This approach supports carbon-aware energy management, fostering more sustainable infrastructure.

## Impact:
 This research demonstrates how data-driven, intelligent energy management can lead to more sustainable, cost-effective infrastructures. It contributes to global sustainability efforts by reducing carbon footprints and optimizing the use of renewable energy.
